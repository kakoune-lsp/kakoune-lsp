//! Convert LSP Range to Kakoune's range-spec, and other position-related utilities.
//! Easy part:
//! * LSP ranges are 0-based, but Kakoune's are 1-based.
//! * LSP ranges are exclusive, but Kakoune's are inclusive.
//! This could be solved by applying a proper offset. A bit more tricky is that to include
//! line ending character LSP range uses an end position denoting the start of the next
//! line. This could be solved by keeping the current line, but setting character offset
//! to an arbitrarily large value, and Kakoune will clamp it to the end of line. The
//! hard part is that LSP uses UTF-16 code units to count character offset, but Kakoune
//! expects bytes. It requires analysis of the buffer content for proper translation.
//! The hardest part is that language servers mostly don't respect the spec, and in a
//! inconsistent way. See https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/376 and
//! https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/b3yzq4/a_lsp_client_maintainers_view_of_the_lsp_protocol/
//! for a bit more details.
//! Temporarily resolution for this problem in kak-lsp is as follows: treat LSP character offset as
//! Unicode scalar value in UTF-8 encoding (and then convert it into byte offset for Kakoune) by
//! default, and treat offset as byte one if specified in the config. It's a horrible violation of
//! both spec and the most obvious spec alternative (UTF-8 code units aka just bytes), but it seems
//! like a viable pragmatic solution before we start to dig deep into the proper support.
//! Pros of this solution for UTF-8 encoded text (and kak-lsp doesn't support other encodings yet):
//! * It's relatively easy to implement in a performant way (thanks to ropey).
//! * It works for entire Basic Multilingual Plane when language server adheres to spec.
//! * It just works when language server sends offset in UTF-8 scalar values (i.e. RLS).
//! * It works for at least Basic Latin when language server sends offset in UTF-8 bytes
//!   (i.e. pyls, clangd with offsetEncoding: utf-8).
//!   And just works when `offset_encoding: utf-8` is provided in the config.
