* Void Linux: `xbps-install -S kak-lsp`

====== Others

[source,sh]
----
wget https://github.com/kakoune-lsp/kakoune-lsp/releases/download/v17.1.2/kakoune-lsp-v17.1.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
tar xzvf kak-lsp-v17.1.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
# replace `~/.local/bin/` with something on your `$PATH`
mv kak-lsp ~/.local/bin/
----

==== From source

Generally, you need the latest stable version of Rust to build kakoune-lsp.

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/kakoune-lsp/kakoune-lsp
cd kakoune-lsp

# this installs the kak-lsp binary to ~/.cargo/bin, which must be in your `$PATH`
cargo install --locked --force --path .
----

==== With plug.kak

If you don't mind using a plugin manager, you can install kakoune-lsp
via https://github.com/andreyorst/plug.kak[plug.kak]. Add this code to your `kakrc`:

[source,kak]
----
plug "kakoune-lsp/kakoune-lsp" do %{
    cargo install --locked --force --path .
}
----

`cargo install` will install the `kak-lsp` binary to `~/.cargo/bin`, which must be in your `$PATH`.
Alternatively, you can replace `cargo install` with `cargo build --release && ln -sf $PWD/target/release/kak-lsp ~/.local/bin/`
where `~/.local/bin/` can be replaced with something in your `$PATH`.

Examples of configuration with plug.kak can be found at https://github.com/kakoune-lsp/kakoune-lsp/wiki/Usage-with-plug.kak[Wiki].

=== Install language servers for your desired languages

kakoune-lsp doesn't manage installation of language servers, please install them
by yourself for the languages you plan to use kakoune-lsp with. Please consult the
https://github.com/kakoune-lsp/kakoune-lsp/wiki/How-to-install-servers[How to install servers] wiki page for
quick installation of language servers supported by kakoune-lsp out of the box.

=== Configure Kakoune to enable LSP integration

To enable LSP support for configured languages (see <<Configuration>>) just add the following
commands to your `kakrc`:

[source,kak]
----
eval %sh{kak-lsp --kakoune}  # Not needed if you load it with plug.kak.
lsp-enable
----

A bit more involved but recommended way is to enable LSP only for specific filetypes you need
via `lsp-enable-window`, e.g.:

[source,kak]
----
eval %sh{kak-lsp --kakoune}  # Not needed if you load it with plug.kak.
hook global WinSetOption filetype=(rust|python|go|javascript|typescript|c|cpp) %{
    lsp-enable-window
}
----

=== Configure key mappings

There are three default mappings in goto-mode: `gd` (`lsp-definition`), `gy`
(`lsp-type-definition`) and `gr` (`lsp-references`).  You can override them in your kakrc after
this plugin is loaded.

Here are additional recommended mappings. See below for the meaning of each command.

[source,kak]
----
map global user l %{:enter-user-mode lsp<ret>} -docstring "LSP mode"
map global insert <tab> '<a-;>:try lsp-snippets-select-next-placeholders catch %{ execute-keys -with-hooks <lt>tab> }<ret>' -docstring 'Select next snippet placeholder'
map global object a '<a-semicolon>lsp-object<ret>' -docstring 'LSP any symbol'
map global object <a-a> '<a-semicolon>lsp-object<ret>' -docstring 'LSP any symbol'
map global object f '<a-semicolon>lsp-object Function Method<ret>' -docstring 'LSP function or method'
map global object t '<a-semicolon>lsp-object Class Interface Struct<ret>' -docstring 'LSP class interface or struct'
map global object d '<a-semicolon>lsp-diagnostic-object --include-warnings<ret>' -docstring 'LSP errors and warnings'
map global object D '<a-semicolon>lsp-diagnostic-object<ret>' -docstring 'LSP errors'
----

== Usage

NOTE: Contents below corresponds to the master branch HEAD and could be slightly out-of-sync
with the version installed from pre-built binaries. The most common case is new commands being
in a pre-release testing stage. Please refer to the README.asciidoc revision tagged with the
version you use or the README.asciidoc from the release archive.

If you have followed above steps you get

* completions
* `lsp-definition` command to go to definition, mapped to `gd` by default
* `lsp-hover` command to show hover info (including relevant diagnostics when available) in the info box.
** `lsp-hover-buffer` command to show the same in a scratch buffer.
** to automatically show hover when you move around, use `lsp-auto-hover-enable` or `lsp-auto-hover-buffer-enable`.
** to show hover anchored to hovered position, use `set global lsp_hover_anchor true`
** to exclude diagnostics, use `set-option global lsp_show_hover_format 'printf %s "${lsp_info}"'`

* `lsp-highlight-references` command to select (unless run in a hook context) all references to the symbol under the main cursor in the current buffer and highlight them with the `Reference` face (which is equal to the `MatchingChar` face by default)
* `lsp-document-symbol` command to list the current buffer's symbols in a buffer of type `lsp-document-symbol`
* `lsp-goto-document-symbol` command to jump to one of the current buffer's symbols
* `lsp-workspace-symbol` command to list project-wide symbols matching the query
* `lsp-workspace-symbol-incr` command to incrementally list project-wide symbols matching the query
** `\*symbols*` buffer has filetype `lsp-goto` so you can press `<ret>` on a line or use the `jump` command
* `lsp-diagnostics` command to list project-wide diagnostics (current buffer determines project and language to collect diagnostics for)
** `\*diagnostics*` buffer has filetype `lsp-diagnostics` so you can press `<ret>` on a line or use the `jump` command

** `\*callers*` and `\*callees*` buffers have filetype `lsp-goto` so you can press `<ret>` on a line or use the `jump` command
* `lsp-signature-help` command to show signature information of the function under the main cursor
** To automatically show signature information in insert mode, use `lsp-auto-signature-help-enable`.
* inline diagnostics highlighting using the `DiagnosticError`, `DiagnosticHint`, `DiagnosticInfo` and `DiagnosticWarning` faces; can be disabled with `lsp-inline-diagnostics-disable` command
* flags in the left margin on lines with errors or other diagnostics; can be disabled with `lsp-diagnostic-lines-disable` command
  * for lines with code lenses, a `>` flag which can be customized via the `lsp_code_lens_sign` option
  * `lsp-code-lens` command to execute a code lens from the current selection
  * commands `lsp-inlay-code-lenses-enable` and `lsp-inlay-code-lenses-disable` to toggle rendering of code lenses.
    * You can change the code lenses' face with `set-face global InlayCodeLens <face>`.
* `lsp-formatting` command to format current buffer, according to the `tabstop` and `lsp_insert_spaces` options
* `lsp-formatting-sync` command to format current buffer synchronously, suitable for use with `BufWritePre` hook:

[source,kak]
----
hook global WinSetOption filetype=rust %{
    hook window BufWritePre .* lsp-formatting-sync
}
----

* `lsp-object` command to select adjacent or surrounding syntax tree nodes in [object mode](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/doc/pages/modes.asciidoc#object-mode)
** `lsp-diagnostic-object` does something similar but for inline diagnostics.
* `lsp-next-symbol` and `lsp-previous-symbol` command to go to the buffer's next and current/previous symbol.
* `lsp-hover-next-symbol` and `lsp-hover-previous-symbol` to show hover of the buffer's next and current/previous symbol.
* `lsp-rename <new_name>` and `lsp-rename-prompt` commands to rename the symbol under the main cursor.
* Breadcrumbs in the modeline indicating the symbol around the main cursor, like (`somemodule > someclass > somefunction`).
** To implement this, kakoune-lsp adds `%opt{lsp_modeline} ` to the front of your global `modelinefmt` at load time.
* An hourglass character (⌛) in the modeline whenever the language server indicates it's busy.
** To customize this behavior, override `lsp-handle-progress`.
* If `lsp_auto_show_code_actions` is `true`, a lightbulb (💡) in the modeline whenever code actions are available at the main cursor position
** To customize the lightbulb, you can override `lsp-show-code-actions` and `lsp-hide-code-actions`
* `lsp-code-actions` to open a menu to choose a code action to run
** To customize the menu, you can override `lsp-perform-code-action`
* `lsp-code-action` to run the code action matching the given pattern.
* `lsp-code-action-sync` to synchronously run that code action, suitable for use in a `BufWritePre` hook.
* `lsp_diagnostic_error_count`, `lsp_diagnostic_hint_count`, `lsp_diagnostic_info_count` and `lsp_diagnostic_warning_count` options which contain the number of diagnostics of the respective level for the current buffer. For example, you can put it into your modeline to see at a glance if there are errors in the current file
* starting new kak-lsp session when Kakoune session begins and stopping it when Kakoune session ends
* `lsp-execute-command` command to execute server-specific commands (listed by `lsp-capabilities`).
* Commands starting with either of `ccls-`, `clangd-`, `ejdtls-`, `texlab-` or `rust-analyzer-`, that provide server specific features.

NOTE: By default, kak-lsp exits when it doesn't receive any request from Kakoune for 30 minutes,
even if the Kakoune session is still up and running. Change the `lsp_timeout` option and restart
kak-lsp to tweak this duration, or set it to 0 to disable this behavior. In any scenario,
a new request would spin up a fresh server if it is down. Hence, one way to restart kak-lsp is
to kill the process and then use any LSP feature. Another way is to run `lsp-disable; nop %sh{sleep .3}; lsp-enable`.

* `lsp` https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/doc/pages/modes.asciidoc#user-modes[user mode] with the following default mappings:

|===

To know which subset of LSP commands is backed by the current buffer's filetype's language server use
`lsp-capabilities` command.

== Configuration

kakoune-lsp uses Kakoune options to customize its behavior.

The `lsp_servers` option is a https://github.com/toml-lang/toml[TOML] table that specifies the list
of servers to use for the current buffer.  By default, this option is populated by hooks such as:

[source,kak]
----
hook -group lsp-filetype-clangd global BufSetOption filetype=(?:c|cpp) %{
    set-option buffer lsp_servers %{
        [language_server.clangd]
    }
    lsp-find-root compile_commands.json .clangd .git .hg
}
----

See `kak-lsp --kakoune` for the default set of servers and some commented-out alternatives.

To use different servers, add the corresponding hooks to your `kakrc`.
To remove the defaults, you can use `remove-hooks global lsp-filetype-.*` in your `kakrc`.

Please let us know if you have any ideas about how to make the default config more sensible.

=== Server-specific configuration

Many servers accept configuration options that are not part of the LSP spec.  The TOML table
`[<server_name>.settings]` holds those configuration options.  It has the same structure as
the corresponding fragments from VSCode's `settings.json`. For example:

[source,toml]
----
hook global BufSetOption filetype=go %{
    set-option buffer lsp_servers %{
        [language_server.gopls]
        settings_section = "gopls"
        [language_server.gopls.settings.gopls]
        "formatting.gofumpt" = true
    }
    lsp-find-root Gopkg.toml go.mod .git .hg
}
----

kakoune-lsp sends the section specified by `settings_section`, in this
case `{"formatting.gofumpt":true}` as part of `initializationOptions` and
`workspace/didChangeConfiguration`.  Additionally, kakoune-lsp will send any sections requested
by the server in `workspace/configuration`.

=== Language ID ("languageId")

The current buffer's `lsp_language_id` option value is sent to the language server as `languageId`.
By default it's usually the same as Kakoune's filetype option but depending on the language server it may need to be different.
See `kak-lsp --kakoune` for the default set of exceptions.

=== Multiple language servers

It is possible to map more than one language server to a filetype. For example, if you want to
set up TSServer and TailwindCSS to use in React projects:

[source,kak]
----
hook global BufSetOption filetype=(?:javascript|typescript) %{
    set-option buffer lsp_servers %{
        [language_server.typescript-language-server]
        args = ["--stdio"]
        [language_server.tailwindcss-language-server]
        args = ["--stdio"]
        [language_server.tailwindcss-language-server.settings.tailwindcss]
        editor = {}
    }
    lsp-find-root package.json tsconfig.json jsconfig.json .git .hg
}
----

== Other configuration options

kakoune-lsp declares the following Kakoune options:

* `lsp_completion_trigger` (str): This option is set to a Kakoune command, which is executed every time the user pauses in insert mode. If the command succeeds, kakoune-lsp will send a completion request to the language server.
* `lsp_diagnostic_line_error_sign`, `lsp_diagnostic_line_hint_sign`, `lsp_diagnostic_line_info_sign`, and `lsp_diagnostic_line_warning_sign` (str): When using `lsp-diagnostic-lines-enable` and the language server detects an error or another diagnostic, kakoune-lsp will add a flag to the left-most column of the window, using this string and one of the corresponding faces `LineFlagError`, `LineFlagHint`, `LineFlagInfo` or `LineFlagWarning`.
* `lsp_hover_anchor` (bool): When using `lsp-hover` or `lsp-auto-hover-enable`, if this option is `true` then the hover information will be displayed next to the active selection. Otherwise, the information will be displayed in a box in the lower-right corner.
* `lsp_hover_max_info_lines` (int): If greater than 0 then limit information in the hover box to the given number of lines. Default is 20.
* `lsp_hover_max_diagnostic_lines` (int): If greater than 0 then limit diagnostics in the hover box to the given number of lines. Default is 20.
* `lsp_hover_insert_mode_trigger` (str): This option is set to a Kakoune command. When using `lsp-auto-hover-insert-mode-enable`, this command is executed every time the user pauses in insert mode. If the command succeeds, kakoune-lsp will send a hover-information request for the text selected by the command.
* `lsp_insert_spaces` (bool): When using `lsp-formatting`, if this option is `true`, kakoune-lsp will ask the language server to indent with spaces rather than tabs.
* `lsp_auto_highlight_references` (bool): If this option is `true` then `lsp-highlight-references` is executed every time the user pauses in normal mode.
* `lsp_auto_show_code_actions` (bool): If this option is `true` then `lsp-code-actions` is executed every time the user pauses in normal mode.
* `lsp_snippet_support` (bool): toggles snippet support (completions with placeholders), see <<Snippets>>
* `lsp_file_watch_support` (bool): toggles file watch support, see <<Limitations>>
* `lsp_project_root` (str), the root directory to tell language servers to use, usually set in in buffer scope using `lsp-find-root` via `BufSetOption filetype` hooks

== Inlay hints

Inlay hints are used to show inferred types, parameter names in function calls, and the types of chained calls inline in the code. To enable support for it, add the following to your `kakrc`:

[source,kak]
----
lsp-inlay-hints-enable global
----

You can change the hints' face with `set-face global InlayHint <face>`.

== Semantic Tokens

kakoune-lsp supports the semanticTokens feature for semantic highlighting. If the language server supports it, you can enable it with:

[source,kak]
----
hook global WinSetOption filetype=<language> %{
  hook window -group semantic-tokens BufReload .* lsp-semantic-tokens
  hook window -group semantic-tokens NormalIdle .* lsp-semantic-tokens
  hook window -group semantic-tokens InsertIdle .* lsp-semantic-tokens
  hook -once -always window WinSetOption filetype=.* %{
    remove-hooks window semantic-tokens
  }
}
----

The faces used for semantic tokens and modifiers are defined via the `lsp_semantic_tokens` option, for example:

[source,kak]
----
hook global BufSetOption filetype=<language> %{
    set-option buffer lsp_semantic_tokens %{
        # face                     token    modifiers...
        const_variable_declaration variable constant declaration
        string                     string
    }
}
----

where `face` is the face that will be applied in Kakoune (you'll want to define these in your theme/config), `token` is the token's name as reported by the language server (see `lsp-capabilities`) and `modifiers` is an array of modifier names (also reported by the language server). `modifiers` may be omitted, but `token` and `face` are required.

You may create any arbitrary number of definitions with permutations between the token names and modifiers reported by the server. For an entry to match a token, all the entry's modifiers must exist on the token. However, the token may have additional modifiers not assigned in the config entry. +
kakoune-lsp will find the most specific matching configuration to apply, where specificity is defined as the number of matching modifiers. If multiple matching entries have the same number of modifiers, the one that was defined last in the configuration wins.

*Example:*

Assuming the following configuration,

[source,kak]
----
set-option global lsp_semantic_tokens %{
        # face                     token    modifiers...
        const_variable_declaration variable constant declaration
        const_variable             variable constant
        variable                   variable
}
----

kakoune-lsp will perform these mappings:

[cols="1,1,2,5"]
|===
| Token | Modifiers | Face | Comment

| `variable`
| `constant`, `declaration`
| `const_variable_declaration`
| First entry matches with 2 modifiers.

| `variable`
| `constant`
| `const_variable`
| First and second entry match with 1 modifier, second wins.

| `variable`
| `declaration`
| `variable`
| Only third entry matches. First entry doesn't match, because `constant` is missing.

| `variable`
|
| `variable`
| Third entry matches.

| `function`
|
|
| No entries match and no face is applied.

|===

== Inlay Diagnostics

kakoune-lsp supports showing diagnostics inline after their respective line, but this behavior can be somewhat buggy and must be enabled explicitly:

[source,kak]
----
lsp-inlay-diagnostics-enable global
----

== Markdown rendering in info box

kakoune-lsp shows some additional information provided by the language server in an info box. This information includes documentation for the token under the cursor (`lsp-hover`) and documentation for completion candidates. In both cases, the Language Server Protocol allows for both plain text and Markdown, and most servers do implement Markdown.

To make use of Markdown, kakoune-lsp transpiles it into Kakoune's markup language, utilizing various faces for styling.
These faces all default to the `Information` face, to ensure that the text in the info box works with any color scheme.

To enable Markdown highlighting, define some of the following faces in your theme or `kakrc`:

[cols="1a,3a"]
|===
| Face | Usage

| `InfoDefault`
| The default text color. You'll likely want to leave this at the default `Information`.

| `InfoBlock`
| The face used for code blocks. Language specific syntax highlighting for code blocks is not supported.

| `InfoBlockQuote`
| The face used for block quotes. The `>` Markdown syntax is still rendered.

| `InfoBullet`
| The face used to highlight the list symbol for both ordered and unordered lists. For list items' text, `InfoDefault` is used.

| `InfoHeader`
| The face used for headings. There is currently no distinction between different heading levels.

| `InfoLink`
| The face used to highlight link titles. Maybe some classic `blue+u` for this one?

| `InfoLinkMono`
| This face is assigned to inline code spans within link titles, such as in the following Markdown snippet. Here, the word `format` will receive the `InfoLinkMono` face.

----
[the `format` function](https://example.com)
----

| `InfoMono`
| The face used for inline code spans (backtick strings).

| `InfoRule`
| The face used for horizontal lines (rules).

| `InfoDiagnosticError`
| Used for error messages in the diagnostics inside hover info. This defaults to Kakoune's built-in `Error` face.

| `InfoDiagnosticHint`
| Used for hints in the diagnostics inside hover info.

| `InfoDiagnosticInformation`
| Used for informational messages in the diagnostics inside hover info.

| `InfoDiagnosticWarning`
| Used for warnings in the diagnostics inside hover info.

|===

For convenience, here is a snippet to paste into your theme/config:

[source,kak]
----
face global InfoDefault               Information
face global InfoBlock                 Information
face global InfoBlockQuote            Information
face global InfoBullet                Information
face global InfoHeader                Information
face global InfoLink                  Information
face global InfoLinkMono              Information
face global InfoMono                  Information
face global InfoRule                  Information
face global InfoDiagnosticError       Information
face global InfoDiagnosticHint        Information
face global InfoDiagnosticInformation Information
face global InfoDiagnosticWarning     Information
----

Current limitations of this feature are:

* Language specific syntax highlighting for code blocks is not supported.
* For hyperlinks, only their title (the pretty name) is shown.
* The original syntax for headings is retained to visualize their level.

== Snippets

Snippets are completions that come with placeholders ("tabstops") in the places you likely want
to insert text (for example function call arguments).  The placeholders are highlighted with
the two faces `SnippetsNextPlaceholders` and `SnippetsOtherPlaceholders`.

The `lsp-snippets-select-next-placeholders` command allows to jump to the next tabstop (like
function call arguments). The suggested mapping uses `<tab>` (see <<Configure mappings>>). Here's
a way to bind it to `<c-n>` instead (might need to hide the completion menu with Kakoune's
`<c-o>` command):

[source,kak]
----
map global insert <c-n> '<a-;>:lsp-snippets-select-next-placeholders<ret>' -docstring 'Select next snippet placeholder'
hook global InsertCompletionShow .* %{
  unmap global insert <c-n> '<a-;>:lsp-snippets-select-next-placeholders<ret>'
}
hook global InsertCompletionHide .* %{
  map global insert <c-n> '<a-;>:lsp-snippets-select-next-placeholders<ret>' -docstring 'Select next snippet placeholder'
}
----

Snippet support can be disabled via `set-option global lsp_snippet_support false` and restarting kak-lsp.

== Limitations

https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workspace_didChangeWatchedFiles[`workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`]
is disabled by default; use `set-option global lsp_file_watch_support true` and restart kak-lsp to enable it.

=== Encoding

kakoune-lsp works best with UTF-8 documents.

=== `Position.character` interpretation

The LSP spec says that column offsets (`Position.character`) are to be
interpreted as UTF-16 code units. Many servers violate the spec. Please refer to
https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/376 for some background.

kakoune-lsp adheres to the spec but will prefer UTF-8 offsets if the server advertises
support for UTF-8 offsets via client capabilities `general.positionEncodings` or
https://clangd.llvm.org/extensions.html#utf-8-offsets[clangd protocol extension].

== Troubleshooting

If kakoune-lsp fails try to put this line in your `kakrc` after `kak-lsp --kakoune` invocation:
[source,kak]
----
set global lsp_cmd "kak-lsp -s %val{session} -vvv --log /tmp/kak-lsp.log"
----

to enable debug logging.

If it does not give enough insight to fix the problem or if the problem is a bug in kakoune-lsp itself
please don't hesitate to raise an issue.

=== Default configuration

Please also try to reproduce the issue with a minimal configuration. Sometimes the problem occurs only with specific `lsp*` settings in your `~/.config/kak/*`. Use this command to start Kakoune with kakoune-lsp enabled, both with pristine settings.

=== Crashes

For troubleshooting crashes, you might like to run kakoune-lsp outside of
Kakoune.

To do this:

. *Before launching Kakoune*, run kakoune-lsp with an arbitrary session ID (here `foobar`):

  kak-lsp -s foobar

. In a second terminal, run Kakoune with the same session ID:

  kak -s foobar

== Versioning

kakoune-lsp follows https://semver.org/[SemVer] with one notable difference from common practice: we
don't use 0 major version to indicate that product is not yet reached stability. Even for non-stable
and not feature-complete product user should be clearly informed about breaking change. Therefore we
start with major version 1 and increment it each time when upgrade requires user's attention.
