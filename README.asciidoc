= Kakoune Language Server Protocol Client

kak-lsp is a https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/[Language Server Protocol] client for http://kakoune.org[Kakoune] implemented in https://www.rust-lang.org[Rust].

NOTE: Version 5 is compatible with the latest breaking changes of Kakoune (as of 2018-07-11). If you haven't upgraded Kakoune yet then you might want to use version 4

== Language servers

kak-lsp doesn't manage installation of language servers, please install them
by yourself for the languages you plan to use kak-lsp with. Please consult the
https://github.com/ul/kak-lsp/wiki/How-to-install-servers[How to install servers] wiki page for
quick installation of language servers supported by kak-lsp out of the box.

== Usage

To enable LSP support for configured languages (see the next section) just add following commands to
your `kakrc`:

----
eval %sh{kak-lsp --kakoune -s $kak_session}
----

It adds:

* completions
* `lsp-definition` command to go to definition, mapped to `gd` by default
* `lsp-hover` command to show hover info;
  to automatically show hover when you move around use `lsp-auto-hover-enable`;
  to show hover anchored to hovered position do `set global lsp_hover_anchor true`
* `lsp-references` command to find references for a symbol under the main cursor, mapped to `gr` by default
* `lsp-document-symbol` command to list current buffer's symbols
* `lsp-diagnostics` command to list project-wide diagnostics (current buffer determines project and language to collect diagnostics)
* inline diagnostics highlighting using `DiagnosticError` and `DiagnosticWarning` faces; could be disabled with `lsp-inline-diagnostics-disable` command
* `lsp-formatting` command to format current buffer
* starting new kak-lsp session when Kakoune session begins and stopping it when Kakoune session ends

NOTE: By default, kak-lsp exits when it doesn't receive any request from Kakoune during 30 minutes,
even if Kakoune session is still up and running. Change `server.timeout` in `kak-lsp.toml` to tweak
duration, or set it to 0 to disable this behaviour. In any scenario making new request would lead to
attempt to spin up server if it is down.

To know which subset of kak-lsp commands is backed by current buffer filetype's language server use
`lsp-capabilities` command.

== Configuration

kak-lsp itself has configuration, but it also adds configuration options to Kakoune that affect the Kakoune integration..

=== Configuring kak-lsp

kak-lsp is configured via configuration file in https://github.com/toml-lang/toml[TOML] format. By default kak-lsp tries to read `$HOME/.config/kak-lsp/kak-lsp.toml`, but you can override it with command-line option `--config`.

Look into the default `kak-lsp.toml` in the root of repository, it should be quite self-descriptive.
The only example which is not covered by default `kak-lsp.toml` is setting initialization options
for a language server. It's done like this:

[source=toml]
----
[language.go.initialization_options]
formatTool = "gofmt"
----

If you are setting any options to server via cli do not forget to append them to
`%sh{kak-lsp --kakoune ...}` in your `kakrc`. It's not needed if you change options in
`~/.config/kak-lsp/kak-lsp.toml` file.

Please let us know if you have any ideas about how to make default config more sensible.

=== Configuring Kakoune

kak-lsp's Kakoune integration declares the following options:

* `lsp_completion_trigger` (str): This option is set to a Kakoune command, which is executed every time the user pauses in insert mode. If the command succeeds, kak-lsp will send a completion request to the language server.
* `lsp_diagnostic_line_error_sign` (str): When using `lsp-diagnostic-lines-enable` and the language server detects an error, kak-lsp will add a flag to the left-most column of the window, using this string and the `LineFlagErrors` face.
* `lsp_diagnostic_line_warning_sign` (str): When using `lsp-diagnostic-lines-enable` and the language server detects an warning, kak-lsp will add a flag to the left-most column of the window, using this string and the `LineFlagErrors` face.
* `lsp_hover_anchor` (bool): When using `lsp-hover` or `lsp-auto-hover-enable`, if this option is `true` then the hover information will be displayed next to the active selection. Otherwise, the information will be displayed in a box in the lower-right corner.
* `lsp_hover_insert_mode_trigger` (str): This option is set to a Kakoune command. When using `lsp-auto-hover-insert-mode-enable`, this command is executed every time the user pauses in insert mode. If the command succeeds, kak-lsp will send a hover-information request for the text selected by the command.
* `lsp_insert_spaces` (bool): When using `lsp-formatting`, if this option is `true`, kak-lsp will ask the language server to indent with spaces rather than tabs.
* `lsp_server_configuration` (str-to-str-map): At startup, and when this option is modified, kak-lsp will send its contents to the language server in a `workspace/DidChangeConfiguration` notification. Some languages servers allow dynamic configuration in this way. See below for more information about this option.
* `lsp_tab_size` (int): When using `lsp-formatting`, kak-lsp will ask the language server to assume tabs are this many spaces wide. It's similar to the standard Kakoune option `indent_width`.

NOTE: The `lsp_server_configuration` option is awkward, since the Language Server Protocol ultimately wants an unstructured blob of JSON, kak-lsp works with the more limited TOML format, Kakoune's options are yet more limited, and most of the conversions are done in shell.



== Troubleshooting

If kak-lsp fails try to put this line in your `kakrc` after `kak-lsp --kakoune` invocation:

----
nop %sh{ (kak-lsp -s $kak_session -vvv ) > /tmp/kak-lsp.log 2>&1 < /dev/null & }
----

to explicitly start server and enable debug logging. If it will not give enough insights to fix the
problem or if the problem is a bug in kak-lsp itself please don't hesitate to raise an issue.

NOTE: Some Kakoune plugins could interfere with kak-lsp, particularly completions providers.
E.g. `racer.kak` competes for autocompletion in Rust files.

== Versioning

kak-lsp follows https://semver.org/[SemVer] with one notable difference from common practice: we
don't use 0 major version to indicate that product is not yet reached stability. Even for non-stable
and not feature-complete product user should be clearly informed about breaking change. Therefore we
start with major version 1 and increment it each time when upgrade requires user's attention.
